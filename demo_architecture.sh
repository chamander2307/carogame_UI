echo -e "   ${YELLOW}→${NC} Services Layer (Business Logic)"
echo -e "     • GameStateService.js - State management with validation"
echo -e "     • WebSocketEventHandler.js - Event handling with Observer pattern"  
echo -e "     • GameActionService.js - Game actions with Strategy pattern"
echo ""
echo -e "   ${YELLOW}→${NC} Hooks Layer (Application Logic)"

echo -e "   ${YELLOW}→${NC} Components Layer (Presentation)"
echo -e "     • GamePage.js - Clean UI with dependency injection"

echo -e "${PURPLE}🔧 SOLID Principles Applied:${NC}"
echo -e "   ${GREEN}S${NC} - Single Responsibility: Each service has one clear purpose"
echo -e "   ${GREEN}O${NC} - Open/Closed: Can extend handlers without modifying existing code"
echo -e "   ${GREEN}L${NC} - Liskov Substitution: WebSocket can fallback to REST API"
echo -e "   ${GREEN}I${NC} - Interface Segregation: Hooks expose only needed methods"
echo -e "   ${GREEN}D${NC} - Dependency Inversion: UI depends on abstractions, not concrete services"
echo ""

echo -e "${CYAN}🎨 Design Patterns Used:${NC}"
echo -e "   • Observer Pattern - State change notifications"
echo -e "   • Strategy Pattern - WebSocket vs API selection"
echo -e "   • Facade Pattern - useGameLogic hook"
echo -e "   • Singleton Pattern - Shared game state"
echo -e "   • Factory Method - Creating empty board"
echo -e "   • Template Method - Standardized move process"

echo -e "${GREEN}🚀 Key Benefits:${NC}"
echo -e "   ✅ Maintainable - Clear separation of concerns"
echo -e "   ✅ Testable - Services can be tested independently"
echo -e "   ✅ Scalable - Easy to add new features"
echo -e "   ✅ Reusable - Services can be used across components"
echo -e "   ✅ Performance - Optimistic updates and efficient state management"
